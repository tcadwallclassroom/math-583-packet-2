Recall that the 1st quartile is the ``median'' of the minimum value and
the median, while the 3rd quartile is the ``median'' of the maximum
value and the median\ldots{} sort of. In fact, it's actually silghtly
more complicated than that. For example, consider the simple example of
the data \[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11\]

The median is 6, but what should the first quartile be? Should we
include 6, and get a median of 3.5, or exclude it, at get a median of 3?
Try \texttt{fivenum(c(1:11))} or \texttt{summary(c(1:11))} and see what
R does!

Now try both of the following:

\texttt{fivenum(c(1:10))}

\texttt{summary(c(1:10))}

Why do these give different results? If you want to get \emph{very} deep
into the weeds, check out \texttt{help("quantile")} and read about the
nine different ``types'' it uses to calculate quantiles. You can choose
a type in \texttt{summary} with \texttt{summary(data,quantile.type=X)}
where X is the type described in the help file. The R documentation is
not very easy to read, but the Mathworld page for Quantile is a bit
better, see \url{https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Quantile.html}.
