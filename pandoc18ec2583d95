<p>Note the use of <code>round</code> in the last command; here we are rounding to 12 digits. If you just use <code>mean()</code> in the last step, you will get a very small number in scientific notation. The actual value of the mean is in fact 0, but you are seeing a very small number due to a <em>floating point error</em> in R. These are very common in any programming language, and dealing with them is a necessary evil.</p>
