<p>Recall that the 1st quartile is the “median” of the minimum value and the median, while the 3rd quartile is the “median” of the maximum value and the median… sort of. In fact, it’s actually silghtly more complicated than that. For example, consider the simple example of the data</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11\]</span></p>
<p>The median is 6, but what should the first quartile be? Should we include 6, and get a median of 3.5, or exclude it, at get a median of 3? Try <code>fivenum(c(1:11))</code> or `summary(c(1:11)) and see what R does!</p>
<p>Now try both of the following:</p>
<p><code>fivenum(c(1:10))</code></p>
<p><code>summary(c(1:10))</code></p>
<p>Why do these give different results?</p>
<p>The measures of spread, more technically, are the <em>range</em>, which is the difference of the maximum and minimum, and the <em>interquartile range</em>, or IQR, which is the difference of the 3rd and 1st quartiles. The five number summary contains all this information and more.</p>
