Recall that the 1st quartile is the ``median'' of the minimum value and
the median, while the 3rd quartile is the ``median'' of the maximum
value and the median\ldots{} sort of. In fact, it's actually silghtly
more complicated than that. For example, consider the simple example of
the data

\[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11\]

The median is 6, but what should the first quartile be? Should we
include 6, and get a median of 3.5, or exclude it, at get a median of 3?
Try \texttt{fivenum(c(1:11))} or \texttt{summary(c(1:11))} and see what
R does!

Now try both of the following:

\texttt{fivenum(c(1:10))}

\texttt{summary(c(1:10))}

Do these give different results?
